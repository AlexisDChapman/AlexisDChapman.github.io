        "What makes a hero? A hero is someone that we look up to.
        Heroes embody what we truly value most. Therefore who we select as
        role models says a lot about who we are as people."  -Wise words of Mark Seaman

        This hero that I admire has amazing charcteristics and morals. A few of them are as follows.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Selfless - Puts her own dreams aside to help others</li>
        <li>Determined - Never quits, even when things get hard</li>
        <li>Any size footprint - Has a huge  impact, even if that impact is only on one person/li>
        <li>Inspirational - Inspires and motivates others through their actions</li>
        <li>Integrity - they live true to their calling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
       Maya Moore has sacrificed her career and passion, profeesional basketball, to dedicate her time to helping others. 
       She is one the most respected WNBA players of all time, and now not only becasue of her skill on the court, 
       but also because of her inspirational work off the court. She has spent the last two years dedicating her time
       to helping free and prove the innocence of wronfully imprisoned men, instead of playing basketball. She is 
       an inspiration to all women's basketball players who aim to make a difference in this world, even if it is a small one.
